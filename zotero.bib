  abstract = {Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has become a popular technique for
              solving machine learning (ML) problems when first-order (FO)
              information is difficult or impossible to obtain. However, the
              scalability of ZO optimization remains an open problem: Its use has
              primarily been limited to relatively small-scale ML problems, such
              as sample-wise adversarial attack generation. To our best knowledge
              , no prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of ZO
              optimization in training deep neural networks (DNNs) without a
              significant decrease in performance. To overcome this roadblock, we
              develop DeepZero, a principled ZO deep learning (DL) framework that
              can scale ZO optimization to DNN training from scratch through
              three primary innovations. First, we demonstrate the advantages of
              coordinatewise gradient estimation (CGE) over randomized
              vector-wise gradient estimation in training accuracy and
              computational efficiency. Second, we propose a sparsityinduced ZO
              training protocol that extends the model pruning methodology using
              only finite differences to explore and exploit the sparse DL prior
              in CGE. Third, we develop the methods of feature reuse and forward
              parallelization to advance the practical implementations of ZO
              training. Our extensive experiments show that DeepZero achieves
              state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on ResNet-20 trained on CIFAR-10,
              approaching FO training performance for the first time. Furthermore
              , we show the practical utility of DeepZero in applications of
              certified adversarial defense and DL-based partial differential
              equation error correction, achieving 10-20\% improvement over SOTA.
              We believe our results will inspire future research on scalable ZO
              optimization and contribute to advancing DL with black box. Codes

  abstract = {Contrastive learning has gained significant attention as a method
              for self-supervised learning. The contrastive loss function ensures
              that embeddings of positive sample pairs (e.g., different samples
              from the same class or different views of the same object) are
              similar, while embeddings of negative pairs are dissimilar.
              Practical constraints such as large memory requirements make it
              challenging to consider all possible positive and negative pairs,
              leading to the use of mini-batch optimization. In this paper, we
              investigate the theoretical aspects of mini-batch optimization in
              contrastive learning. We show that mini-batch optimization is
              equivalent to full-batch optimization if and only if all \${
              \textbackslash}binom\{N\}\{B\}\$ mini-batches are selected, while
              sub-optimality may arise when examining only a subset. We then
              demonstrate that utilizing high-loss mini-batches can speed up SGD
              convergence and propose a spectral clustering-based approach for
              identifying these high-loss mini-batches. Our experimental results

  abstract = {In continual learning, a learner has to keep learning from the
              data over its whole life time. A key issue is to decide what
              knowledge to keep and what knowledge to let go. In a neural network
              , this can be implemented by using a step-size vector to scale how
              much gradient samples change network weights. Common algorithms,
              like RMSProp and Adam, use heuristics, specifically normalization,
              to adapt this step-size vector. In this paper, we show that those
              heuristics ignore the effect of their adaptation on the overall
              objective function, for example by moving the step-size vector away
              from better step-size vectors. On the other hand, stochastic
              meta-gradient descent algorithms, like IDBD (Sutton, 1992),
              explicitly optimize the step-size vector with respect to the
              overall objective function. On simple problems, we show that IDBD
              is able to consistently improve step-size vectors, where RMSProp
              and Adam do not. We explain the differences between the two
              approaches and their respective limitations. We conclude by
              suggesting that combining both approaches could be a promising
              future direction to improve the performance of neural networks in
              continual learning.},

  abstract = {In reinforcement learning (RL), it is easier to solve a task if
              given a good representation. While deep RL should automatically
              acquire such good representations, prior work often finds that
              learning representations in an end-to-end fashion is unstable and
              instead equip RL algorithms with additional representation learning
              parts (e.g., auxiliary losses, data augmentation). How can we
              design RL algorithms that directly acquire good representations? In
              this paper, instead of adding representation learning parts to an
              existing RL algorithm, we show (contrastive) representation
              learning methods can be cast as RL algorithms in their own right.
              To do this, we build upon prior work and apply contrastive
              representation learning to action-labeled trajectories, in such a
              way that the (inner product of) learned representations exactly
              corresponds to a goal-conditioned value function. We use this idea
              to reinterpret a prior RL method as performing contrastive learning
              , and then use the idea to propose a much simpler method that
              achieves similar performance. Across a range of goal-conditioned RL
              tasks, we demonstrate that contrastive RL methods achieve higher
              success rates than prior non-contrastive methods, including in the
              offline RL setting. We also show that contrastive RL outperforms

              for solving large reinforcement learning problems, where
              exploration, generalization, and transfer are particularly
              challenging. The Laplacian representation is a promising approach
              to address these problems by inducing informative state encoding
              and intrinsic rewards for temporally-extended action discovery and
              reward shaping. To obtain the Laplacian representation one needs to
              compute the eigensystem of the graph Laplacian, which is often
              approximated through optimization objectives compatible with deep
              learning approaches. These approximations, however, depend on
              hyperparameters that are impossible to tune efficiently, converge

              learning from human feedback (RLHF), that do not require a separate
              reward model. However, the preference datasets used in DAP methods
              are usually collected ahead of training and never updated, thus the
              feedback is purely offline. Moreover, responses in these datasets
              are often sampled from a language model distinct from the one being

              phase is inevitably off-policy. In this study, we posit that online

              via human evaluation in several tasks that OAIF outperforms both

              leveraging unsupervised learning in RL, but also enables plug-in
              solutions for convex RL. In the offline setting, we propose an
              algorithm for off-policy estimation of occupancies that can handle
              non-exploratory data. Using this as a subroutine, we further devise
              an online algorithm that constructs exploratory data distributions
              in a level-by-level manner. As a central technical challenge, the
              additive error of occupancy estimation is incompatible with the
              multiplicative definition of data coverage. In the absence of
              strong assumptions like reachability, this incompatibility easily
              leads to exponential error blow-up, which we overcome via novel
              technical tools. Our results also readily extend to the
              representation learning setting, when the density features are
              unknown and must be learned from an exponentially large candidate
              set.},

  abstract = {Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL), a framework that
              trains a policy with offline RL and then further fine-tunes it with
              online RL, has been considered a promising recipe for data-driven
              decision-making. While sensible, this framework has drawbacks: it
              requires domain-specific offline RL pre-training for each task, and
              is often brittle in practice. In this work, we propose
              unsupervised-to-online RL (U2O RL), which replaces domain-specific
              supervised offline RL with unsupervised offline RL, as a better
              alternative to offline-to-online RL. U2O RL not only enables
              reusing a single pre-trained model for multiple downstream tasks,
              but also learns better representations, which often result in even
              better performance and stability than supervised offline-to-online
              RL. To instantiate U2O RL in practice, we propose a general recipe
              for U2O RL to bridge task-agnostic unsupervised offline skill-based
              policy pre-training and supervised online fine-tuning. Throughout
              our experiments in nine state-based and pixel-based environments,
              we empirically demonstrate that U2O RL achieves strong performance
              that matches or even outperforms previous offline-to-online RL
              approaches, while being able to reuse a single pre-trained model
              for a number of different downstream tasks.},

  abstract = {Selecting exploratory actions that generate a rich stream of
              experience for better learning is a fundamental challenge in
              reinforcement learning (RL). An approach to tackle this problem
              consists in selecting actions according to specific policies for an
              extended period of time, also known as options. A recent line of
              work to derive such exploratory options builds upon the
              eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian. Importantly, until now these
              methods have been mostly limited to tabular domains where (1) the
              graph Laplacian matrix was either given or could be fully estimated
              , (2) performing eigendecomposition on this matrix was
              computationally tractable, and (3) value functions could be learned
              exactly. Additionally, these methods required a separate option
              discovery phase. These assumptions are fundamentally not scalable.
              In this paper we address these limitations and show how recent
              results for directly approximating the eigenfunctions of the
              Laplacian can be leveraged to truly scale up options-based
              exploration. To do so, we introduce a fully online deep RL
              algorithm for discovering Laplacianbased options and evaluate our
              approach on a variety of pixel-based tasks. We compare to several
              state-of-the-art exploration methods and show that our approach is
              effective, general, and especially promising in non-stationary
              settings.},

  abstract = {Despite overparameterization, deep networks trained via supervised
              learning are easy to optimize and exhibit excellent generalization.
              One hypothesis to explain this is that overparameterized deep
              networks enjoy the benefits of implicit regularization induced by
              stochastic gradient descent, which favors parsimonious solutions
              that generalize well on test inputs. It is reasonable to surmise
              that deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods could also benefit
              from this effect. In this paper, we discuss how the implicit
              regularization effect of SGD seen in supervised learning could in
              fact be harmful in the offline deep RL setting, leading to poor
              generalization and degenerate feature representations. Our
              theoretical analysis shows that when existing models of implicit
              regularization are applied to temporal difference learning, the
              resulting derived regularizer favors degenerate solutions with
              excessive ``aliasing'', in stark contrast to the supervised
              learning case. We back up these findings empirically, showing that
              feature representations learned by a deep network value function
              trained via bootstrapping can indeed become degenerate, aliasing
              the representations for state-action pairs that appear on either
              side of the Bellman backup. To address this issue, we derive the
              form of this implicit regularizer and, inspired by this derivation,
              propose a simple and effective explicit regularizer, called DR3,
              that counteracts the undesirable effects of this implicit
              regularizer. When combined with existing offline RL methods, DR3
              substantially improves performance and stability, alleviating
              unlearning in Atari 2600 games, D4RL domains and robotic
              manipulation from images.},

              on the predictions of a weaker model, a strong pretrained student
              can learn to correct the weak model's errors and generalize to
              examples where the teacher is not confident, even when these
              examples are excluded from training. This enables learning from
              cheap, incomplete, and possibly incorrect label information, such
              as coarse logical rules or the generations of a language model. We

              coverage expansion, respectively. We give a new bound based on
              expansion properties of the data distribution and student
              hypothesis class that directly accounts for pseudolabel correction
              and coverage expansion. Our bounds capture the intuition that

              unable to fit the mistakes of the weak teacher without incurring
              additional error. We show that these expansion properties can be

              effective in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
              preferences, but gathering high-quality preference labels is
              expensive. RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF), introduced in Bai et al.
              (2022b), offers a promising alternative that trains the reward
              model (RM) on preferences generated by an off-the-shelf LLM. Across
              the tasks of summarization, helpful dialogue generation, and
              harmless dialogue generation, we show that RLAIF achieves
              comparable performance to RLHF. Furthermore, we take a step towards
              ``self-improvement'' by demonstrating that RLAIF can outperform a
              supervised finetuned baseline even when the AI labeler is the same
              size as the policy, or even the exact same checkpoint as the

              directly from an off-the-shelf LLM during RL, which achieves
              superior performance to canonical RLAIF. Our results suggest that
              RLAIF can achieve performance on-par with using human feedback,

              diverse DL hardware has boosted the research and development of DL
              compilers in the community. Several DL compilers have been proposed
              from both industry and academia such as Tensorflow XLA and TVM.
              Similarly, the DL compilers take the DL models described in
              different DL frameworks as input, and then generate optimized codes
              for diverse DL hardware as output. However, none of the existing
              survey has analyzed the unique design architecture of the DL
              compilers comprehensively. In this paper, we perform a
              comprehensive survey of existing DL compilers by dissecting the
              commonly adopted design in details, with emphasis on the DL
              oriented multi-level IRs, and frontend/backend optimizations. We

              directed exploration emerging from a simple RL algorithm long
              before any successful trials are observed. For example, in a
              manipulation task, the agent is given a single observation of the
              goal state and learns skills, first for moving its end-effector,
              then for pushing the block, and finally for picking up and placing
              the block. These skills emerge before the agent has ever
              successfully placed the block at the goal location and without the
              aid of any reward functions, demonstrations, or manually-specified
              distance metrics. Once the agent has learned to reach the goal
              state reliably, exploration is reduced. Implementing our method
              involves a simple modification of prior work and does not require

  abstract = {Reasoning at multiple levels of temporal abstraction is one of the
              key attributes of intelligence. In reinforcement learning, this is
              often modeled through temporally extended courses of actions called
              options. Options allow agents to make predictions and to operate at
              different levels of abstraction within an environment. Nevertheless
              , approaches based on the options framework often start with the
              assumption that a reasonable set of options is known beforehand.
              When this is not the case, there are no definitive answers for
              which options one should consider. In this paper, we argue that the
              successor representation, which encodes states based on the pattern
              of state visitation that follows them, can be seen as a natural
              substrate for the discovery and use of temporal abstractions. To
              support our claim, we take a big picture view of recent results,
              showing how the successor representation can be used to discover
              options that facilitate either temporally-extended exploration or
              planning. We cast these results as instantiations of a general
              framework for option discovery in which the agent's representation
              is used to identify useful options, which are then used to further
              improve its representation. This results in a virtuous,
              never-ending, cycle in which both the representation and the
              options are constantly refined based on each other. Beyond option
              discovery itself, we also discuss how the successor representation
              allows us to augment a set of options into a combinatorially large
              counterpart without additional learning. This is achieved through
              the combination of previously learned options. Our empirical
              evaluation focuses on options discovered for temporally-extended
              exploration and on the use of the successor representation to
              combine them. Our results shed light on important design decisions
              involved in the definition of options and demonstrate the synergy
              of different methods based on the successor representation, such as
              eigenoptions and the option keyboard.},

  abstract = {Fine-tuning language models (LMs) has yielded success on diverse
              downstream tasks, but as LMs grow in size, backpropagation requires
              a prohibitively large amount of memory. Zeroth-order (ZO) methods
              can in principle estimate gradients using only two forward passes
              but are theorized to be catastrophically slow for optimizing large
              models. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient zerothorder
              optimizer (MeZO), adapting the classical ZO-SGD method to operate
              in-place, thereby fine-tuning LMs with the same memory footprint as
              inference. For example, with a single A100 80GB GPU, MeZO can train
              a 30-billion parameter model, whereas fine-tuning with
              backpropagation can train only a 2.7B LM with the same budget. We
              conduct comprehensive experiments across model types (masked and
              autoregressive LMs), model scales (up to 66B), and downstream tasks
              (classification, multiple-choice, and generation). Our results
              demonstrate that (1) MeZO significantly outperforms in-context
              learning and linear probing; (2) MeZO achieves comparable
              performance to fine-tuning with backpropagation across multiple
              tasks, with up to 12x memory reduction and up to 2x GPU-hour
              reduction in our implementation; (3) MeZO is compatible with both
              full-parameter and parameter-efficient tuning techniques such as
              LoRA and prefix tuning; (4) MeZO can effectively optimize
              non-differentiable objectives (e.g., maximizing accuracy or F1). We
              support our empirical findings with theoretical insights,
              highlighting how adequate pre-training and task prompts enable MeZO
              to fine-tune huge models, despite classical ZO analyses suggesting
              otherwise.},

              A variety of off-policy learning algorithms have been developed to
              learn such predictions, but as yet there is little work on how to
              adapt the behavior to gather useful data for those off-policy

              continual auxiliary task learning problem, for both prediction
              learners and the behavior learner. We develop an algorithm based on
              successor features that facilitates tracking under non-stationary

              and rewards provides convergence rate improvements. We conduct an

              policy optimization, where the policy is optimized to maximize a
              reward while staying close to a reference policy with respect to an
              \$f\$-divergence such as the \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{KL\}\$
              divergence. The best of \$n\$ alignment policy selects a sample
              from the reference policy that has the maximum reward among \$n\$
              independent samples. For both cases (policy alignment and best of
              \$n\$), recent works showed empirically that the reward improvement
              of the aligned policy on the reference one scales like \${
              \textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}mathsf\{KL\}\}\$, with an
              explicit bound in \$n\$ on the \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{KL\}\$ for
              the best of \$n\$ policy. We show in this paper that the \${
              \textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}mathsf\{KL\}\}\$ information
              theoretic upper bound holds if the reward under the reference
              policy has sub-gaussian tails. Moreover, we prove for the best of
              \$n\$ policy, that the \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{KL\}\$ upper bound
              can be obtained for any \$f\$-divergence via a reduction to
              exponential order statistics owing to the R{\textbackslash}'enyi
              representation of order statistics, and a data processing
              inequality. If additional information is known on the tails of the
              aligned policy we show that tighter control on the reward
              improvement can be obtained via the R{\textbackslash}'enyi
              divergence. Finally we demonstrate how these upper bounds transfer
              from proxy rewards to golden rewards which results in a decrease in
              the golden reward improvement due to overestimation and
              approximation errors of the proxy reward.},

              goals, allowing one to estimate the transit time between two
              states. However, prior attempts to define such temporal distances
              in stochastic settings have been stymied by an important
              limitation: these prior approaches do not satisfy the triangle
              inequality. This is not merely a definitional concern, but
              translates to an inability to generalize and find shortest paths.
              In this paper, we build on prior work in contrastive learning and
              quasimetrics to show how successor features learned by contrastive
              learning (after a change of variables) form a temporal distance
              that does satisfy the triangle inequality, even in stochastic
              settings. Importantly, this temporal distance is computationally
              efficient to estimate, even in high-dimensional and stochastic
              settings. Experiments in controlled settings and benchmark suites
              demonstrate that an RL algorithm based on these new temporal
              distances exhibits combinatorial generalization (i.e., "stitching")

  abstract = {Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is a promising approach
              to extend traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods to solve
              more complex tasks. Yet, the majority of current HRL methods
              require careful task-specific design and on-policy training, making
              them difficult to apply in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
              study how we can develop HRL algorithms that are general, in that
              they do not make onerous additional assumptions beyond standard RL
              algorithms, and efficient, in the sense that they can be used with
              modest numbers of interaction samples, making them suitable for
              real-world problems such as robotic control. For generality, we
              develop a scheme where lower-level controllers are supervised with
              goals that are learned and proposed automatically by the
              higher-level controllers. To address efficiency, we propose to use
              off-policy experience for both higher and lower-level training.
              This poses a considerable challenge, since changes to the
              lower-level behaviors change the action space for the higher-level
              policy, and we introduce an off-policy correction to remedy this
              challenge. This allows us to take advantage of recent advances in
              off-policy model-free RL to learn both higher- and lower-level
              policies using substantially fewer environment interactions than
              on-policy algorithms. We term the resulting HRL agent HIRO and find
              that it is generally applicable and highly sample-efficient. Our
              experiments show that HIRO can be used to learn highly complex
              behaviors for simulated robots, such as pushing objects and
              utilizing them to reach target locations, learning from only a few
              million samples, equivalent to a few days of real-time interaction.
              In comparisons with a number of prior HRL methods, we find that our
              approach substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art
              techniques.},

              large language models (LLMs) with human values by training directly
              on human preference datasets, eliminating the need for reward
              models. However, due to the presence of cross-domain human
              preferences, direct continual training can lead to catastrophic
              forgetting, limiting DPO's performance and efficiency. Inspired by
              intraspecific competition driving species evolution, we propose a
              Online Fast-Slow chasing DPO (OFS-DPO) for preference alignment,
              simulating competition through fast and slow chasing among models
              to facilitate rapid adaptation. Specifically, we first derive the
              regret upper bound for online learning, validating our motivation
              with a min-max optimization pattern. Based on this, we introduce
              two identical modules using Low-rank Adaptive (LoRA) with different
              optimization speeds to simulate intraspecific competition, and
              propose a new regularization term to guide their learning. To
              further mitigate catastrophic forgetting in cross-domain scenarios,
              we extend the OFS-DPO with LoRA modules combination strategy,
              resulting in the Cross domain Online Fast-Slow chasing DPO
              (COFS-DPO). This method leverages linear combinations of fast
              modules parameters from different task domains, fully utilizing
              historical information to achive continual value alignment.
              Experimental results show that OFS-DPO outperforms DPO in in-domain
              alignment, while COFS-DPO excels in cross-domain continual learning

              applied mathematicians: the design and analysis of modern
              algorithms are rooted in a broad mathematical toolbox that includes
              ergodic theory of Markov chains, Hamiltonian dynamical systems,
              transport maps, stochastic differential equations, information
              theory, optimization, Riemannian geometry, and gradient flows,
              among many others. These lecture notes celebrate the breadth of
              mathematical ideas that have led to tangible advancements in Monte
              Carlo methods and their applications. To accommodate a diverse
              audience, the level of mathematical rigor varies from chapter to
              chapter, giving only an intuitive treatment to the most technically
              demanding subjects. The aim is not to be comprehensive or
              encyclopedic, but rather to illustrate some key principles in the
              design and analysis of Monte Carlo methods through a
              carefully-crafted choice of topics that emphasizes timeless over
              timely ideas. Algorithms are presented in a way that is conducive

  abstract = {Recent work in language modeling demonstrates that training large
              transformer models advances the state of the art in Natural
              Language Processing applications. However, very large models can be
              quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. In this work,
              we present our techniques for training very large transformer
              models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel
              approach that enables training transformer models with billions of
              parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library
              changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model
              parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a
              few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this
              approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion
              parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the
              entire application with 76\% scaling efficiency when compared to a
              strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30
              \% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can
              further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3
              billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a
              3.9 billion parameter model similar to BERT. We show that careful
              attention to the placement of layer normalization in BERT-like
              models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model
              size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we achieve SOTA results on the

              (66.5\% compared to SOTA accuracy of 63.2\%) datasets. Our BERT
              model achieves SOTA results on the RACE dataset (90.9\% compared to

              given environment, instantly with no additional planning or
              learning, after an initial reward-free learning phase. This marks a
              shift from the reward-centric RL paradigm towards "controllable"
              agents that can follow arbitrary instructions in an environment.
              Current RL agents can solve families of related tasks at best, or
              require planning anew for each task. Strategies for approximate
              zero-shot RL ave been suggested using successor features (SFs)
              [BBQ+ 18] or forward-backward (FB) representations [TO21], but
              testing has been limited. After clarifying the relationships
              between these schemes, we introduce improved losses and new SF
              models, and test the viability of zero-shot RL schemes
              systematically on tasks from the Unsupervised RL benchmark
              [LYL+21]. To disentangle universal representation learning from
              exploration, we work in an offline setting and repeat the tests on
              several existing replay buffers. SFs appear to suffer from the
              choice of the elementary state features. SFs with Laplacian
              eigenfunctions do well, while SFs based on auto-encoders, inverse
              curiosity, transition models, low-rank transition matrix,
              contrastive learning, or diversity (APS), perform unconsistently.
              In contrast, FB representations jointly learn the elementary and
              successor features from a single, principled criterion. They
              perform best and consistently across the board, reaching 85\% of
              supervised RL performance with a good replay buffer, in a zero-shot

              explicit near-optimal policies for any reward specified a
              posteriori. During an unsupervised phase, we use reward-free
              interactions with the environment to learn two representations via
              off-the-shelf deep learning methods and temporal difference (TD)
              learning. In the test phase, a reward representation is estimated
              either from observations or an explicit reward description (e.g., a
              target state). The optimal policy for that reward is directly
              obtained from these representations, with no planning. We assume
              access to an exploration scheme or replay buffer for the first
              phase. The corresponding unsupervised loss is well-principled: if
              training is perfect, the policies obtained are provably optimal for
              any reward function. With imperfect training, the sub-optimality is
              proportional to the unsupervised approximation error. The FB

  abstract = {In this paper we investigate the properties of representations
              learned by deep reinforcement learning systems. Much of the early
              work on representations for reinforcement learning focused on
              designing fixed-basis architectures to achieve properties thought
              to be desirable, such as orthogonality and sparsity. In contrast,
              the idea behind deep reinforcement learning methods is that the
              agent designer should not encode representational properties, but
              rather that the data stream should determine the properties of the
              representation---good representations emerge under appropriate
              training schemes. In this paper we bring these two perspectives
              together, empirically investigating the properties of
              representations that support transfer in reinforcement learning. We
              introduce and measure six representational properties over more
              than 25 thousand agent-task settings. We consider Deep Q-learning
              agents with different auxiliary losses in a pixel-based navigation
              environment, with source and transfer tasks corresponding to
              different goal locations. We develop a method to better understand
              why some representations work better for transfer, through a
              systematic approach varying task similarity and measuring and
              correlating representation properties with transfer performance. We
              demonstrate the generality of the methodology by investigating
              representations learned by a Rainbow agent that successfully
              transfer across games modes in Atari 2600.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LMs) such as GPT-3 have the surprising
              ability to do in-context learning, where the model learns to do a
              downstream task simply by conditioning on a prompt consisting of
              input-output examples. The LM learns from these examples without
              being explicitly pretrained to learn. Thus, it is unclear what
              enables in-context learning. In this paper, we study how in-context
              learning can emerge when pretraining documents have long-range
              coherence. Here, the LM must infer a latent document-level concept
              to generate coherent next tokens during pretraining. At test time,
              in-context learning occurs when the LM also infers a shared latent
              concept between examples in a prompt. We prove when this occurs
              despite a distribution mismatch between prompts and pretraining
              data in a setting where the pretraining distribution is a mixture
              of HMMs. In contrast to messy large-scale datasets used to train
              LMs capable of in-context learning, we generate a small-scale
              synthetic dataset (GINC) where Transformers and LSTMs both exhibit
              in-context learning1. Beyond the theory, experiments on GINC
              exhibit large-scale real-world phenomena including improved
              in-context performance with model scaling (despite the same
              pretraining loss), sensitivity to example order, and instances
              where zero-shot is better than few-shot in-context learning.},

              offline datasets has spurred interest in the reinforcement learning
              (RL) field to investigate whether the same paradigms can be
              translated to RL algorithms. This research area, known as offline
              RL, has largely focused on offline policy optimization, aiming to
              find a return-maximizing policy exclusively from offline data. In
              this paper, we consider a slightly different approach to
              incorporating offline data into sequential decision-making. We aim
              to answer the question, what unsupervised objectives applied to
              offline datasets are able to learn state representations which
              elevate performance on downstream tasks, whether those downstream
              tasks be online RL, imitation learning from expert demonstrations,
              or even offline policy optimization based on the same offline
              dataset? Through a variety of experiments utilizing standard
              offline RL datasets, we find that the use of pretraining with
              unsupervised learning objectives can dramatically improve the
              performance of policy learning algorithms that otherwise yield
              mediocre performance on their own. Extensive ablations further
              provide insights into what components of these unsupervised
              objectives \{--\} e.g., reward prediction, continuous or discrete
              representations, pretraining or finetuning \{--\} are most

  abstract = {In the evolving landscape of natural language processing (NLP),
              fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with
              first-order (FO) optimizers like SGD and Adam has become standard.
              Yet, as LLMs grow \{in size\}, the substantial memory overhead from
              back-propagation (BP) for FO gradient computation presents a
              significant challenge. Addressing this issue is crucial, especially
              for applications like on-device training where memory efficiency is
              paramount. This paper proposes a shift towards BP-free,
              zeroth-order (ZO) optimization as a solution for reducing memory
              costs during LLM fine-tuning, building on the initial concept
              introduced by MeZO. Unlike traditional ZO-SGD methods, our work
              expands the exploration to a wider array of ZO optimization
              techniques, through a comprehensive, first-of-its-kind benchmarking
              study across five LLM families (Roberta, OPT, LLaMA, Vicuna,
              Mistral), three task complexities, and five fine-tuning schemes.
              Our study unveils previously overlooked optimization principles,
              highlighting the importance of task alignment, the role of the
              forward gradient method, and the balance between algorithm
              complexity and fine-tuning performance. We further introduce novel
              enhancements to ZO optimization, including block-wise descent,
              hybrid training, and gradient sparsity. Our study offers a
              promising direction for achieving further memory-efficient LLM

              deliver superior performance across a broad range of domains.
              Despite the remarkable progress made in the field of machine
              learning systems research, which has enabled the development and
              exploration of large models, such abilities remain confined to a
              small group of advanced users and industry leaders, resulting in an
              implicit technical barrier for the wider community to access and
              leverage these technologies. In this paper, we introduce PyTorch
              Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) as an industry-grade solution
              for large model training. FSDP has been closely co-designed with
              several key PyTorch core components including Tensor implementation
              , dispatcher system, and CUDA memory caching allocator, to provide
              non-intrusive user experiences and high training efficiency.

              time-series questions. For example, goal-conditioned reinforcement
              learning can be viewed as learning representations to predict which
              states are likely to be visited in the future. While prior methods
              have used contrastive predictive coding to model time series data,
              learning representations that encode long-term dependencies usually
              requires large amounts of data. In this paper, we introduce a

              the amount of data required to learn predictions of future events.
              We apply this representation learning method to derive an
