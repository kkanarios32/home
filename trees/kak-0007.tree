\tag{note}

\p{For these notes, I will attempt to refresh my knowledge of measure-theoretic probability along with learning stochastic processes for the first time. I will be following [Probability and Stochastics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-87859-1) by Cinlar. Unfortunately, there are no solutions to exercises, but it is by far the best written book I have found.}
