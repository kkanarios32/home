\p{I am currently on a run of bad productivity days. Hopefully, this will be resolved with a lighter exercise load next week.}

\section{Daily Summary}{
    \strong{Contrastive RL:} Today, I did spend a bit of time on this project. Mainly, I have been accumulating useful tips from productive researchers, and they recommend not rushing to publish but rather deeply understanding your field first. Due to this, I have decided to take a brief step back and survey the field a bit.
    \ul{
      \li{I quickly went over a parallel line of work based on Laplacian representations of transition dynamics. It seems there is an explicit correspondence between these approaches and the successor representation I have grown accustomed to. A question I plan to explore is what advantages one approach offers over the other? Maybe there is a slick way to compute one efficiently?}
      \li{I also have come to the realization that I do not need to implement the ant gather environment in its entirety right away. Just re-using the ant ball environment and respawning the ball when it is reached should be enough?}
    }
\strong{Weak-to-strong Generalization:} Unfortunately, this is what I spent most of my time on today. We have an upcoming presentation on the topic and so I obviously obsessively have tried to understand everything that may come up as a question.
\ul{
    \li{The prevailing result of today is that our previous formulation was not very good. (Exciting I know)}
    \li{My main takeaway is that if we assume a latent concept space i.e. 
##{\mathrm{LLM}(Y \mid X) = \int_{\Theta} f(Y \mid X, \theta) p(\theta \mid X) d\theta}
    In the previous formulation, the ICL task can only correspond to \strong{one} #{\theta}. This is because then if we assume ICL is doing bayesian update it can identify #{\theta}.
    }
    \ul{
        \li{Not sold on if this is true.}
        \li{Main question is what do they mean by overlap?}
        \ul{
            \li{Does each #{q_i(Y \mid X) = q(Y \mid X, \theta_i)} have non-overlapping output space?}
            \li{Or are they referring to the assumption that the target task is a single #{\theta_i}?}
          }
      }
  }
}

\section{Tomorrow Todo's}{
\ul{
  \li{I intend to be a probabilist next semester, so I must refresh probabliity background ASAP. Aim for 1-2hrs of probability book.}
  \li{For research,}
  \ul{
    \li{\strong{CRL stuff:} Implement non-stationary ant ball. Hopefully, get some sort of experiment running. }
    \li{\strong{Compilers stuff:} Might be meeting with group tomorrow?}
    \li{\strong{LLMs stuff:} If left over time, then dive into alternative interesting formulations (unlikely).}
  }
  \li{As my next reading endeavour, I intend to deeply understand the successor features survey by Machado and Doina. This will probably be a paper of the month as I cannot possibly digest the 70 page behemoth in the next week.}
  \li{As another thing todo, is get better at writing these todo's. Ideally, they will be much more actionable as I continue making these logs. I guess we'll see.}
}
