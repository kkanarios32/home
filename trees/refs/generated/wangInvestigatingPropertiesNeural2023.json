Much of the early work on representations for reinforcement learning focused on designing fixed-basis architectures to achieve properties thought to be desirable, such as orthogonality and sparsity.

In this paper we bring these two perspectives together, empirically investigating the properties of representations that support transfer in reinforcement learning. We introduce and measure six representational properties over more than 25 thousand agent-task settings. We consider Deep Q-learning agents with different auxiliary losses in a pixel-based navigation environment, with source and transfer tasks corresponding to different goal locations. We develop a method to better understand why some representations work better for transfer, through a systematic approach varying task similarity and measuring and correlating representation properties with transfer performance.
