[{"URL": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02080", "abstract": "Large language models (LMs) such as GPT-3 have the surprising ability to do in-context learning, where the model learns to do a downstream task simply by conditioning on a prompt consisting of input-output examples. The LM learns from these examples without being explicitly pretrained to learn. Thus, it is unclear what enables in-context learning. In this paper, we study how in-context learning can emerge when pretraining documents have long-range coherence. Here, the LM must infer a latent document-level concept to generate coherent next tokens during pretraining. At test time, in-context learning occurs when the LM also infers a shared latent concept between examples in a prompt. We prove when this occurs despite a distribution mismatch between prompts and pretraining data in a setting where the pretraining distribution is a mixture of HMMs. In contrast to messy large-scale datasets used to train LMs capable of in-context learning, we generate a small-scale synthetic dataset (GINC) where Transformers and LSTMs both exhibit in-context learning1. Beyond the theory, experiments on GINC exhibit large-scale real-world phenomena including improved in-context performance with model scaling (despite the same pretraining loss), sensitivity to example order, and instances where zero-shot is better than few-shot in-context learning.", "accessed": {"date-parts": [[2024, 10, 15]]}, "author": [{"family": "Xie", "given": "Sang Michael"}, {"family": "Raghunathan", "given": "Aditi"}, {"family": "Liang", "given": "Percy"}, {"family": "Ma", "given": "Tengyu"}], "id": "xieExplanationContextLearning2022", "issued": {"date-parts": [[2022, 7]]}, "keyword": "Computer Science - Computation and Language,Computer Science - Machine Learning", "language": "en-US", "number": "arXiv:2111.02080", "publisher": "arXiv", "title": "An Explanation of In-context Learning as Implicit Bayesian Inference", "type": "", "original_bibtex": "@misc{xieExplanationContextLearning2022,\n title = {An {{Explanation}} of {{In-context Learning}} as {{Implicit Bayesian Inference}}},\n author = {Xie, Sang Michael and Raghunathan, Aditi and Liang, Percy and Ma, Tengyu},\n year = {2022},\n urldate = {2024-10-15},\n number = {arXiv:2111.02080},\n publisher = {arXiv},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/RKQR98C3/Xie et al. - 2022 - An Explanation of In-context Learning as Implicit Bayesian Inference.pdf},\n keywords = {Computer Science - Computation and Language,Computer Science - Machine Learning},\n langid = {english},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n abstract = {Large language models (LMs) such as GPT-3 have the surprising ability to do in-context learning, where the model learns to do a downstream task simply by conditioning on a prompt consisting of input-output examples.
