Monte Carlo methods are an exciting subject for mathematical statisticians and computational and applied mathematicians: the design and analysis of modern algorithms are rooted in a broad mathematical toolbox that includes ergodic theory of Markov chains, Hamiltonian dynamical systems, transport maps, stochastic differential equations, information theory, optimization, Riemannian geometry, and gradient flows, among many others.
