[{"abstract": "Safe reinforcement learning (RL) focuses on training reward-maximizing agents subject to pre-defined safety constraints.

In this work, we formulate the versatile safe RL problem and consider two primary requirements: training efficiency and zero-shot adaptation capability. To address them, we introduce the Constraint-Conditioned Policy Optimization (CCPO) framework, consisting of two key modules: (1) Versatile Value Estimation (VVE) for approximating value functions under unseen threshold conditions, and (2) Conditioned Variational Inference (CVI) for encoding arbitrary constraint thresholds during policy optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CCPO outperforms the baselines in terms of safety and task performance, while preserving zero-shot adaptation capabilities to different constraint thresholds data-efficiently.
