\title{#{\sigma}-field of RV}
\taxon{definition}
\p{The #{\sigma}-field generated by a [[kak-001W]] is the smallest #{\sigma}-field such that the [[kak-001W]] is [measurable](kak-001W). For a sequence of [[kak-001W]]'s, the [[kak-000O]] generated by them is the smallest [[kak-000O]], such that each of the [[kak-001W]]'s is measurable.
