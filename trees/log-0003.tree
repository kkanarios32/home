\p{This day did not quite go to plan. The contrastive RL repo is not exactly how imagined it...}

\section{Daily Summary}{
    \strong{GPU Project:}
    \ul{
      \li{Have GPU kernel for part of chaining algorithm. Makes a CPU call for another part}
      \ul{
        \li{
          Need to write a kernel for a naturally sequential DP.
        }
        \li{
            My initial impression is just how to reuse any memory accesses that have been done for the current GPU kernel.
          }
      }
      \li{Key question is does even a naive kernel implementation speed up the overall program due to the eliminated memory transfer between GPU and CPU? }
      }
    \strong{Contrastive RL:}
    \ul{
      \li{Question is how to do contrastive RL in a lifelong setting? i.e. non-episodic and potentially changing reward functions.}
      \li{Have a pretty good idea how to implement the ant gather environment. However, current setup returns object positions.}
      \ul{
          \li{ If there are a lot (potentially infinite) apples / bombs this will not work.}
          \li{ Need to modify so observations are images, but this makes problem significantly harder. }
        }
    }
}

\section{Tomorrow Todo's}{
\ul{
  \li{Might not have time for self-study tomorrow. It is a packed day.}
  \li{For research,}
  \ul{
    \li{\strong{CRL stuff:} Render ant gather environment. Hopefully, before compilers meeting. }
    \li{\strong{Compilers stuff:} Have meeting. Need actionable goals for runtime information logging. }
    \li{\strong{LLMs stuff:} After group meeting, must make slides on weak-to-strong. Look at new version of paper.}
  }
  \li{If I somehow have extra time, then continue with probability self study. Ideally, I get through the background chapter by Monday. We want to get to probability measures to do probability!}
  \ul{
      \li{It seems it may also be a good idea to get some background with discrete stochastic processes, so I may concurrently follow along an MIT courseware course. TBD.}
    }
}
